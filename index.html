   Yes, I’m Rhy—don’t wear it out. I might not think of myself as anything special, but I bring my unique flair to the game. Sure, my aim might not always be the best, but when it comes down to clutch moments, I’m the one who steps up. Give me an Operator or any sniper, and I’m in my element—it’s where I really shine. I main Iso, which suits my playstyle perfectly: calculated, precise, and ready to adapt (most of the time).
Of course, I have my moments where I overthink. After every mistake or bad play, I’ll be the one analyzing what went wrong and maybe crying a little on the inside—it’s just part of who I am. Despite the self-doubt, I’d argue that I’m the best teammate you could ask for, though the rest of my team, especially Ice, might have a different opinion.
What sets me apart is my specialty: pure, unexplainable luck. Whether it’s pulling off an impossible shot or surviving in the unlikeliest situations, I seem to have fate on my side more often than not. Playing Valorant isn’t just about the game for me; it’s about the laughs, the camaraderie, and the endless banter that make every match worth it.
